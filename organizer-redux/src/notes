Optimization ideas:

Currently there's a lot of lag, here're ideas to avoid it when possible

- Daily todos:

    - at start fetch all (active and completed)
        - request will be all with deadline < today AND all with complete_date : today
    - on fetch success will store them in 2 objects:
        - data
        - completed
    - on status update will keep current logic but won't fetch them (separate action type from update)
        - and will move them from one object to the other



TODOs for the day:

done - fix bug with deadline (on entering new day all todos marked as completed should be set to incompleted
 done  - check box will keep the old logic with toggle done prop,
 done  - on enter will check if date_completed is today and set it to null, an done to false if it's not

done - Add total prop to each todo (on complete/uncomplete add the amount done to a total for later stats)


- fetch daily todos and all lists on start (App.js)
- Add select list on edit todo
- Set default list on create todo (or load them all as other?)

- Add timer
