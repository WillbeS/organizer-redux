Optimization ideas:

Currently there's a lot of lag, here're ideas to avoid it when possible

- Daily todos:

    - at start fetch all (active and completed)
        - request will be all with deadline < today AND all with complete_date : today
    - on fetch success will store them in 2 objects:
        - data
        - completed
    - on status update will keep current logic but won't fetch them (separate action type from update)
        - and will move them from one object to the other
